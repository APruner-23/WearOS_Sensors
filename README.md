# How to start Backend python Server
In order to start the server, python3 should be installed in your device.

## 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this github repository by typing the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/APruner-23/WearOS_Sensors.git`

## 2. Install dependencies
Navigate to the Backend server directory by using the command:
`cd backend_server`
Install the dependencies in your virtual environment (recommended) or in your system by typing the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 3. Run the server
Run the server by typing the following command:
`python3 backend.py`

Once done the server will be running on port 5000, and the smartwatch should be able to send data to it, if it is not able to send data it's probably because of firewall issues.
